# Abstract controller providing basic CRUD actions.
# This implementation mainly follows the one of the Rails scaffolding
# controller and responses to HTML and JSON requests. Some enhancements were made to ease extendability.
# Several protected helper methods are there to be (optionally) overriden by subclasses.
# With the help of additional callbacks, it is possible to hook into the action procedures without
# overriding the entire method.
