= DRY CRUD

{<img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/codez/dry_crud.png" />}[http://travis-ci.org/codez/dry_crud]

dry_crud generates simple and extendable controllers, views and helpers that support you to DRY up the CRUD code in your Rails projects. Start with these artifacts and build a clean base to efficiently develop your application upon.

Create your Rails application directly with the dry_crud application template:

  rails new APP_NAME -m https://raw.github.com/codez/dry_crud/master/template.rb

If your application already exists or you prefer the DIY way, then install the Gem (<tt>gem install dry_crud</tt>), add it to your Gemfile and run the generator. You may remove the Gemfile entry again afterwards, it is not required anymore.

  rails generate dry_crud [--templates haml] [--tests rspec]

By default, dry_crud generates ERB templates and Test::Unit tests. Pass the options above to generate HAML templates and/or RSpec examples instead.

To integrate dry_crud into your code, only a few additions are required:

* For uniform CRUD functionality, just subclass your controllers from CrudController.
* Overwrite the +to_s+ method of your models for a human-friendly representation in captions.

Version 2.0 and higher are compatible with Rails 4 and Rails 3.2. dry_crud is tested with Ruby 1.9.3, 2.0.0 and JRuby. If you are using Ruby 1.8.7, please refer to version 1.7.0.

== Overview

In most Rails applications, you have some models that require basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality. There are various possibilities like Rails scaffolding, {Inherited Resources}[https://github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources] or {Dry Scaffold}[http://github.com/grimen/dry_scaffold]. Still, various parts in your application remain duplicated. While you might pull up common methods into a common superclass controller, most views still contain very similar code. And then you also have to remember the entire API of these frameworks.

Enter dry_crud.

<b>
The main idea of dry_crud is to concentrate basic functionality of your application, like CRUD actions, uniform formatting, forms and tables into specifically extendable units. dry_crud generates various foundation classes that you may browse easily and adapt freely to your application's needs. For each model, you may transparently customize arbitrary parts or just fallback to the general behavior. This applies not only for controllers, but also for view templates and helpers. There is no black box your code depends on. You lay the foundation that fits your application best.
</b>

dry_crud is a Rails generator. All code resides in your application and is open for you to inspect and to extend. You may pick whatever you consider useful or adapt what is not sufficient. Even if you do not require any CRUD functionality, you might find some helpers simplifying your work. There are no runtime dependencies to the dry_crud gem. Having said this, dry_crud does not want to provide a maximum of functionality that requires a lot of configuration, but rather a clean and lightweight foundation to build your application's requirements upon. This is why dry_crud comes as a generator and not as a Rails plugin.

dry_crud does not depend on any other plugins, but easily allows you to integrate them in order to unify the behavior of your CRUD controllers. You might even use the plugins mentioned above to adapt your generated CrudController base class. All classes come with thorough tests that provide you with a solid foundation for implementing your own adaptions.

A basic CSS gets you started with your application's layout. For advanced needs, dry_crud supports the styles and classes used in {Bootstrap}[http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/]. A great design never was so close.

If you find yourself adapting the same parts of dry_crud for your applications over and over, please feel free to {fork me on Github}[http://github.com/codez/dry_crud].

See the Examples section for some use cases and the Generated Files section below for details on the single classes and templates.

== Examples

=== Controller with CRUD functionality

Say you want to manage a +Person+ model. Create the following controller and overwrite the +to_s+ method of your model for a human-friendly representation used in page titles.

<tt>app/controllers/people_controller.rb</tt>:
  class PeopleController < CrudController
    self.permitted_attrs = [:firstname, :lastname, :birthday, :sex, :city_id]
  end

The +permitted_attrs+ define the parameter attributes allowed when creating or updating a model entry (see {Strong Paramters}[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/StrongParameters.html]).

<tt>app/models/person.rb</tt>:
  class Person
    def to_s
      "#{lastname} #{firstname}"
    end
  end

That's it. You have a sortable overview of all people, detail pages and forms to edit and create people. Of course, you may delete people as well. By default, all attributes are displayed and formatted according to their column type wherever they appear. This applies for the input fields as well.


==== Customize single views

Well, maybe there are certain attributes you do not want to display in the people list, or others that are not editable in the form. No problem, simply create a <tt> _list</tt> partial in <tt>app/views/people/_list.html.erb</tt> to customize this:

  <%= crud_table :lastname, :firstname, :city, :sex %>

This only displays these three attributes in the table. All other templates, as well as the main index view, fallback to the ones in <tt>app/views/crud</tt>.


==== Adapt general behavior

Next, let's adapt a part of the general behavior used in all CRUD controllers. As an example, we include pagination with kaminari[https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari] in all our overview tables:

In <tt>app/controllers/list_controller.rb</tt>, change the list_entries method to

  def list_entries
    model_scope.page(params[:page])
  end

In <tt>app/views/list/index.html.erb</tt>, add the following line for the pagination links:
   <%= paginate entries %>

And we are done. All our controllers inheriting from ListController, including above +PeopleController+, now have paginated index views. Because our customization for the people table is in the separate <tt>_list</tt> partial, no further modifications are required.


==== Special formatting for selected attributes

Sometimes, the default formatting provided by +format_attr+ will not be sufficient. We have a boolean column +sex+ in our model, but would like to display 'male' or 'female' for it (instead of 'no' or 'yes', which is a bit cryptic). Just define a method in your view helper starting with <tt>format_</tt>, followed by the class and attribute name:

In <tt>app/helpers/people.rb</tt>:
  def format_person_sex(person)
    person.sex ? 'female' : 'male'
  end

Should you have attributes with the same name for multiple models that you want to be formatted the same way, you may define a helper method <tt>format_{attr}</tt> for these attributes.

By the way: The method +f+ in FormatHelper uniformly formats arbitrary values according to their class.


==== Sorting and filtering the index list

The entries listed on the index page are automatically sortable by each displayed database column. To apply a default sorting order, define the following class attribute in the controller:

In <tt>app/controllers/people_controller.rb</tt>:
  self.default_sort = 'lastname, firstname'

When you display computed values in your list table, you may define sort mappings to enable sorting of these columns:

In <tt>app/controllers/people_controller.rb</tt>:
  self.sort_mappings = {age: 'birthday', city_id: 'cities.name'}

There is also a simple search functionality (based on SQL LIKE queries) implemented in ListController. Define an array of columns in your controller's +search_columns+ class variable to make the entries searchable by these fields:

In <tt>app/controllers/people_controller.rb</tt>:
  self.search_columns = [:firstname, :lastname]

If you have search columns defined, a search box will be displayed in the index view that enables filtering of the displayed entries.


=== Standard Tables and Forms

dry_crud provides two builder classes for update/create forms and tables for displaying entries of one model. They may be used all over your application to DRY up the form and table code. Normally, they are used with the corresponding methods from TableHelper and FormHelper. In there are generic helper methods (+plain_table+ and +plain_form+/+standard_form+) and slightly enhanced ones for views of subclasses of CrudController (+crud_table+ and +crud_form+).

==== Tables

The following code defines a table with some attribute columns for a list of same-type entries. Columns get a header corresponding to the attribute name:
  <%= plain_table(@people) do |t|
        t.sortable_attrs :lastname, :firstname
      end %>

If entries is empty, a basic 'No entries found' message is rendered instead of the table.

To render custom columns, use the +col+ method with an appropriate block:
  <%= plain_table(@people) do |t|
        t.sortable_attrs :lastname, :firstname
        t.col('', class: 'center') {|entry| image_tag(entry.picture) }
        t.attr :street
        t.col('Map') {|entry| link_to(entry.city, "http://maps.google.com/?q=#{entry.city}" }
      end %>

For views of subclasses of ListController, you can directly use the +crud_table+ helper method, where you do not have to pass the +@people+ list explicitly and actions are added automatically.

==== Forms

Forms work very similar. In the most simple case, you just have to specify which attributes of a model to create input fields for, and you get a complete form with error messages, labeled input fields according the column types and a save button:

  <%= standard_form(@person, :firstname, :lastname, :age, :city) -%>

Of course, custom input fields may be defined as well:
  <%= standard_form(@person, url: custom_update_person_path(@person.id)) do |f| %>
    <%= f.labeled_input_fields :firstname, :lastname %>
    <%= f.labeled(:sex) do %>
      <%= f.radio_button :sex, true %> female
      <%= f.radio_button :sex, false %> male
    <% end %>
    <%= f.labeled_integer_field :age %>
    <%= f.labeled_file_field :picture %>
  <% end %>

Even +belongs_to+ associations are automatically rendered with a select field. By default, all entries from the associated model are used as options. To customize this, either define an instance variable with the same name as the association in your controller, or pass a <tt>list</tt> option:
  <%= f.belongs_to_field :hometown, list: City.where(country: @person.country) %>

Yes, it's bad practice to use finder logic in your views! Define the variable <tt>@hometowns</tt> in your controller instead (as shown in the example above), and you do not even have to specify the <tt>list</tt> option.

Optionally, +has_and_belongs_to_many+ and +has_many+ associations can be rendered with a multi-select field. Similar to a +belongs_to+ association, all entries from the associated model are used, but can be overwritten using the <tt>list</tt> option:
  <%= f.has_many_field :visited_cities, list: City.where(is_touristic: true) %>

And yes again, the same advice for where to put finder logic applies here as well.

<b>Note:</b> +has_and_belongs_to_many+ and +has_many+ associations are not automatically rendered in a form, you have to explicitly include these attributes. You might also want to stylize the multi-select widget, for example with a {jQuery UI Multiselect}[http://www.quasipartikel.at/multiselect/].


=== Nested Resources

In case you define nested resources, your CrudController subclass should know. Listing and creating entries as well as displaying links for these resources is dependent on the nesting hierarchy. This is how you declare the namespaces and parent resources in your controller:

  self.nesting = :my_namspace, ParentResource

This declaration is for a controller nested in +parent_resources+ within a +:my_namespace+ scope. +ParentResource+ is the corresponding +ActiveRecord+ model. The request param +:parent_resource_id+ is used to load the parent entry, which in turn is used to filter the entries listed and created in your controller. For all parent resources, a corresponding instance variable is created.

The <tt>Crud::Nestable</tt> module defines this basic behaviour. For more complex setups, have a look there and adjust it to your needs.


=== CRUD controller callbacks

As a last example, let's say we have added a custom input field that must specially processed. Instead of overwriting the entire update action, it is possible to register callbacks for the +create+, +update+, +save+ (= +create+ and +update+) and +destroy+ actions. They work very similarliy like the callbacks on ActiveRecord. For each action, before and after callbacks are run. Before callbacks may also prevent the action from being executed when returning false. Here is some code:

In <tt>app/controllers/people_controller.rb</tt>:
  after_save :upload_picture
  before_destroy :delete_picture

  def upload_picture
    store_file(params[:person][:picture]) if params[:person][:picture]
  end

  def delete_picture
    if !perform_delete_picture(entry.picture)
      flash.alert = 'Could not delete picture'
      false
    end
  end

Beside these "action" callbacks, there is also a set of "before render" callbacks that are called whenever a certain view is rendered. They are available for the +index+, +show+, +new+, +edit+ and +form+ (= +new+ and +edit+) views. These callbacks are not only called for the corresponding action, but, for example, also when the +new+ view is going to be rendered from an unsuccessfull +create+ action. Say you need to prepare additional variables whenever the form is rendered:

In <tt>app/controllers/people_controller.rb</tt>:
  before_render_form :set_hometowns

  def set_hometowns
    @hometowns = City.where(country: entry.country)
  end


=== Internationalization (I18N)

All text strings used are externalized to an english locale yaml. The keys are organized by controller and template name plus a generic global scope.

To represent your controller hierarchy, a special translation helper +ti+ looks up keys along the hierarchy in the following order:
  {controller_name}.{template_name}.{key}
  {controller_name}.{action_name}.{key}
  {controller_name}.global.{key}
  {parent_controller_name}.{template_name}.{key}
  {parent_controller_name}.{action_name}.{key}
  {parent_controller_name}.global.{key}
  ...
  global.{key}

In order to change the title for your +PeopleController+'s +index+ action, you do not need to override the entire template, but simply define the following key:
  people.index.title = "The People"

Otherwise, the lookup for the title would fallback on the ListController's key <tt>list.index.title</tt>.

This lookup mechanism also allows you to easily define per-controller overridable text snippets in your views.


== Generated Files

All generated files are supposed to provide a reasonable foundation for the CRUD functionality. You are encouraged to adapt them to fit the needs of your application. They're yours!

=== Views:

All templates in the +list+ and +crud+ folders may be 'overriden' individually in a respective view folder. Define the basic structure of your CRUD views here and adapt it as required for each single model. Actually, the <tt>_list.html.erb</tt> partial from the +list+ folder gets overriden in the +crud+ folder already.
All templates are available as HAML as well.

==== List

views/list/index.html.erb:: The index view displaying a sortable table with all entries. If you have +search_columns+ defined for your controller, then a search box is rendered as well.

views/list/_list.html.erb:: A partial defining the table in the index view. To change the displayed attributes for your list model, just create an own <tt>_list.html.erb</tt> in your controller's view directory.

views/list/_search.html.erb:: A partial defining a simple search form that is displayed when +search_columns+ are defined in a subclassing controller.

views/list/_actions_index.html.erb:: The action links available in the index view. None by default.
